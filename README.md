# Functions

Python Functions Practice Projects

This repository contains six small Python projects focused on practicing and improving skills in working with functions. Each file demonstrates a different concept of defining, calling, and using functions in real examples.

# Project Structure

1. BasicFunctionDefinition.py

Introduction to defining and calling simple functions.

2. DefaultParameters.py

Demonstrates how to use default parameter values in functions.

3. FunctionsCallingOtherFunctions.py

Shows how functions can call other functions to structure code better.

4. FunctionWithReturnValue.py

Explains how functions can return values for further use.

5. MultipleReturnValues.py

Demonstrates how a function can take a list of numbers, process each element, and return a new list as the result.

In this example, each number in the list is increased by 2, and the updated list is returned.

RecursiveFunction.py

Covers recursion â€” functions that call themselves to solve problems.
